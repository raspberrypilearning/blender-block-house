## Create half a roof

To create the roof, start by selecting an edge.

+ Select the **edge** tool from the bottom menu.

+ Drag it upwards using the blue handle.

Now you have half a house with one edge going up to a point. You need to create the other half of the roof, but you cannot do that with a cube, because there are not enough parts to this cube to create the right shape.

In the next step you will learn how to use a tool called **extrude**, which will allow you to complete your house.
