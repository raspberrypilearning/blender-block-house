## Vertices, edges and faces

+ Open Blender and close the splash screen. You will see that a cube has been automatically added for you.

If you rotate around the cube using the middle mouse button, it doesn't look particularly house-like at the moment. You might be tempted to go to the Create tab on the Toolbox and add a cone on top of the cube. For example:

![Block and cone](images/blender-block-and-cone.png)

But that's not a very good solution at all. It is far easier to edit the cube itself to make it look like a house.

+ Select the cube, then go to edit mode by selecting **Edit mode** from the lower menu.

Now you are in a mode where you can edit every part of the cube and start to reshape it.

There are three options: you can select to edit vertices, edges or faces from the menu at the bottom.

If you don't like the new shape you have created, you can press <kbd>CTRL + Z<kbd> to undo the changes.

### Faces
